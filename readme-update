#SIMPLE CALCULATOR 
This is a simple application created and deleveloped by JAVA using OOP's concepts.



We use many import functions provided in java like :-
import android.app.Dialog;
import android.graphics.Color;
import android.graphics.drawable.ColorDrawable;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.view.View;
import android.widget.Button;
import android.widget.TextView;
import android.widget.Toast;


The UI is being made which displays the binary digits and the calculation symbols which are to be performed such as addition, subtraction , multiplication and division.
The inputs are taken by the functions and performs simple calculations.

Andriod studio is used for this project.
